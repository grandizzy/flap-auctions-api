# Local testchain and starting auctions

To create surplus for kicking flap auctions see:
- install project using `./install-dev.sh` script from root dir
- run `./start_testchain.sh` from tests dir
- run `./start_test_api.sh` from tests dir
- run `./simulate_flap.sh` from tests dir (as many auctions you want to kick)
